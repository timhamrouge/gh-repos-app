# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use:
clone the repo to your local machine, then run `npm i` and then `npm start` in the console and the development server should open in the browser for you. Then you can use the search form to search for repos and select one from the list to click through the the Repo page to see the Readme.

## The app uses:
React, React hooks, Material UI v5, Styled-components, typescript

## To-do list:
- Handle api request loading and errors properly
- use custom hooks or something other than fetchto make the API requests
- Update the types to be actual types
- Pagination on the search request
- format the Readme on the Repo page to be in markup
- have repos state persist when navigating back from the repo page to the search page
- specs
